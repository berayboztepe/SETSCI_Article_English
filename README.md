<h1 align="center">Development of a Deep Learning Based Model for Recognizing the Environmental Sounds in Videos</h1>

**Abstract** â€” Nowadays, decomposition of various environmental sounds for environment recognition has gained popularity.
Various background sounds in videos could be classified with high success with deep learning and machine learning techniques.
In this way, semantically enriched video scenes can be depicted. This work contains the process of developing a convenient deep
learning neural network model for environmental sounds recognition. In training the developed model, ten main categories have
been chosen from a dataset that has various data to test the model's prediction power by experiment. From the limited data
available, first, spectrograms have been produced and then, these spectrograms have been enriched by the help of data
augmentation techniques. In this way, attribute diversity that was gained from data has been increased. Also, with three different
design approaches for training the model, source codes have been written. These codes have been created by using deep learning
network model-based methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Long Short Term Memory, Gated Recurrent Unit. Seven
different designed neural network models have been trained by experiments and achievement has been proved by tests. With the
highest accuracy obtained from one of the generated models, approximately %87 of accuracy has been obtained. This work
contains obtained experimental results and scientific evaluation.

<p align:"center"> **I. Introduction** </p>

    Sound Recognition, which emerged with the development of technology, is a technology based on the analysis of the audio signal. This process can be performed using Deep Learning methods like many other methods. To these methods; Methods such as creating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) by creating a spectrogram, and establishing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) using Time Series can be given as examples.
